# Viewing the Code

Check if your Android SDK on **Android 15.0** ( _"VanillaIceCream", API Level: 35_ ). If not, change it to that.

Do the following to view the code for TeleOp:
1.  Open the TeleOp folder in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=en).
2.  Check if the project structure's Android Gradle Plugin Version is on ***8.7.3*** and also that the Gradle Version is on ***8.9***.
<br/>

Do the following to view the code for Autonomous:
1.  Open the Autonomous folder in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=en).
2.  Check if the project structure's Android Gradle Plugin Version is on ***8.7.3*** and also that the Gradle Version is on ***8.9***.
3.  Follow step **<ins>nine</ins>** in the [MeepMeep Documentation](https://github.com/acmerobotics/MeepMeep?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-android-studio) to visualize the path used in this season.

# Notes

If you are to copy the Autonomous code for your new season, you will need to tune it to your new robot.
Follow the steps on [RoadRunner Documention](https://learnroadrunner.com/feedforward-tuning.html) to tune your robot. ( _You will need to every single tuning it says, except for deadwheels if you aren't using them._ )

If you are to copy the PID used in the DriveTeleOp, you will also need to tune it to your new robot ( _The "p", "i", "d", and "f" variables_ ). Tuning can be done in the FTC Dashboard for the PID.
