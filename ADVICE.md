# Practial Advice

This is basically some knowledge I acquired this season that can really help when coding.<br>
(This is heavily a WIP)

## Editing configuration values

Use FTCDashboard to edit constants in your code, and make sure to use constants throughout your code as well.<br>
Using constants along with FTCDashboard reduces the number of times you need to build the code to the robot, which takes eons to build.<br><br>

To use FTCDashboard, connect to the robot's Wi-Fi on your laptop/computer and go to `192.168.43.1:8080/dash`. Once there, locate your values and edit them.<br><br>

Do note that the values are temporary and not permanent, so you should copy the values to the Android Studio code and build after finding the correct values.
